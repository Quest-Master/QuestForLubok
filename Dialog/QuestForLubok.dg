(intro)
	Come here and let me tell you the tale of my peoples' fate.(par)
	As the night is vanquished by the morning rays of the sun's light. You are standing before the stone castle that, in appearance. It was crafted by the hands of the once local village. But over time, the light had faded away into the darkness of the night. The cold hand of death choked the life from this land. A curse had been struck upon this once peaceful place.(par)
	Now, you must vanquish the Dark Prince Lubok, rid this land of his affliction and return this land to the realm of the living.

	Rows of strange and unknown plants from places yet to be discovered. A few begin to sway as if they were alive. Strange mixtures of colors used in such patterns to draw in prey. You see that you aren't alone by means of a Skeleton.

(from * go #north to #r31)
(from * go #south to #r33)
(look *)
	A large plant standing roughly four feet tall resembled that of a flower not quite ready to bloom.

#r39
(room *)
(name *)	r39
(from * go #east to #r38)

(from * go #north to #r93)
(from * go #south to #r122)
(look *)
	You find yourself standing before a long passage leading to who knows. Then from the corner of your eye, you spot a faint Ghost standing there as if it didn't notice you.

#r122
(room *)
(name *)	r122
(from * go #north to #r121)
(from * go #south to #r123)

(from * go #east to #r126)
(from * go #north to #r124)
(look *)
	Columns held the ceiling up as the means of existence was pushed to the brink. There was nothing more than the constant reminder of death. The anquish looks of misery upon the faces of those bodies left to rot by hanging from the ceiling. It was nothing more than a room of death.

#r126
(room *)
(name *)	r126
(from * go #north to #r123)

#r127
(room *)
(name *)	r127
(from * go #south to #r128)
(from * go #west to #r123)
(look *)
	There was standing before you. A well lit hallway that went about telling the tale of how the Dark Prince Lubok came to power. It was nothing more than a fantasy. Detailing the means of how he took power.

#r128
(room *)
(name *)	r128
(from * go #north to #r127)
(from * go #south to #r129)
(look *)

(from * go #south to #r132)
(from * go #west to #r138)
(look *)
	You stop for a moment and come to the end of the vast window. There within the darkness of the night, te moon hung high, and from within the night sky something can be seen flying about. Searching for prey nonetheless.

#r132
(room *)
(name *)	r132
(from * go #north to #r131)

(from * go #north to #r137)
(from * go #south to #r135)

#r137
(room *)
(name *)	r137
(from * go #east to #r138)
(from * go #south to #r136)
(look *)
	Faint music began to play. Everything about this place seemed off. It was nothing more than a break within the fabric of reality. The means of the power that Lubok had at his disposal was enough to drive fear within your very body began to take hold of you.

#r138
(room *)
(name *)	r138
(from * go #east to #r131)
