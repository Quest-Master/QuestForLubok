(intro)
	Come here and let me tell you the tale of my peoples' fate.(par)
	As the night is vanquished by the morning rays of the sun's light. You are standing before the stone castle that, in appearance. It was crafted by the hands of the once local village. But over time, the light had faded away into the darkness of the night. The cold hand of death choked the life from this land. A curse had been struck upon this once peaceful place.(par)
	Now, you must vanquish the Dark Prince Lubok, rid this land of his affliction and return this land to the realm of the living.

(from * go #north to #r117)
(from * go #west to #r120)

#r120
(room *)
(name *)	r120
(from * go #east to #r119)
(look *)
	Standing before you is that of a statue. The statue depicted that of Mari. The statue six feet tall and carved out of marble. She was covered in a purple cloak. Her hair was flowing in the non-existent breeze. Her face was beautiful and here she was with a powerful source of magic.

(from * go #east to #r126)
(from * go #north to #r124)
(look *)
	Columns held the ceiling up as the means of existence was pushed to the brink. There was nothing more than the constant reminder of death. The anquish looks of misery upon the faces of those bodies left to rot by hanging from the ceiling. It was nothing more than a room of death.

#r126
(room *)
(name *)	r126
(from * go #north to #r123)

(room *)
(name *)	r127
(from * go #south to #r128)
(from * go #west to #r123)
(look *)
	There was standing before you. A well lit hallway that went about telling the tale of how the Dark Prince Lubok came to power. It was nothing more than a fantasy. Detailing the means of how he took power.

#r128
(room *)
(name *)	r128
(from * go #north to #r127)
(from * go #south to #r129)

(from * go #south to #r132)
(from * go #west to #r138)
(look *)
	You stop for a moment and come to the end of the vast window. There within the darkness of the night, te moon hung high, and from within the night sky something can be seen flying about. Searching for prey nonetheless.

#r132
(room *)
(name *)	r132
(from * go #north to #r131)

#r137
(room *)
(name *)	r137
(from * go #east to #r138)
(from * go #south to #r136)
(look *)
	Faint music began to play. Everything about this place seemed off. It was nothing more than a break within the fabric of reality. The means of the power that Lubok had at his disposal was enough to drive fear within your very body began to take hold of you.

#r138
(room *)
(name *)	r138
(from * go #east to #r131)

#r148
(room *)
(name *)	r148
(from * go #east to #r149)
(from * go #west to #r147)
(look *)
	With every passing moment. You feel as if there isn't much for you here except for the tortured bodies of the dead. They seem to be docile. Its not what you were told by those others who travel amongst in the wild.

#r149
(room *)
(name *)	r149
(from * go #east to #r150)
(from * go #west to #r148)

(name *)	r153
(from * go #east to #r152)
(from * go #west to #r154)

#r154
(room *)
(name *)	r154
(from * go #east to #r153)
(from * go #west to #r155)

(name *)	r158
(from * go #east to #r159)
(from * go #west to #r157)

	The ground beneath your feet seems to have grown over quite a lot. Its a shame that with all these people at rest one couldn't be spared to at least work to show them some respect.

#r159
(room *)
(name *)	r159
(from * go #east to #r160)
(from * go #west to #r158)
