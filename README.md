# Quest For Lubok

A text based game like those one would find in the early eighties. I'm rewriting my first game that I wrote as a kid all those years ago. This is just a fun little project that I'm writing it in QBASIC. It's just something I've been thinking about doing for quite sometime. The original file format for QFL is that of .BAS which is the standard for Qbasic. As for what you see on here is just a plain text version. Which is easy to read and to understand. I will post when I have the time and will attempt to be frequent.

Quest for Lubok is about an adventurer who finds a seemingly abandoned castle. Overcoming their fear of the unknown, they decide to enter. Little do they know that within the castle walls lies an entire world, frozen in time. A world of sinister magic and despair, where the shadows prey on the weary and weak.

Your constant companion is unease as you try to  solve the mystery of dark Prince Lubok. By exploring dusty halls, creaking staircases leading to the unknown, or visiting an abandoned clocktower or paying your respects to the dead in a forgotten graveyard, you will find out more about the world and its inhabitants, of its heroes rooted in legends, of hopes, hardships, and a hint of madness that intertwines with all.

Beware though, the further you advance, the more likely it will be that your life inadvertently becomes entangled in matters most unexpected. Enter at your own peril, for there might not be any return.
